## About

Join Antonio for a non-technical talk on the recent emergence of AI generated content. This presentation will explore how content is created as well as the impact on coders, writers, visual artists, and designers. If you create content or mostly consume it, these new technologies have the potential to effect us all online in a profound way. Bring your curiosity and opinions on AI and its potential impact in art & literature, gaming, academia, business, and even private communication.
