# Functional Animations for Better User Experience

Last year we talked about how easy it is to add animations into your web sites and applications using CSS and Javascript [https://youtu.be/_QQVWW2imcU](https://youtu.be/_QQVWW2imcU). Now that we have the basics out of the way, we'll talk about using animations as tools to improve user experience: from navigating your site, to filling out a form, or even just interacting with your application better. With minimal additional code make your projects a more memorable and enjoyable experience.
