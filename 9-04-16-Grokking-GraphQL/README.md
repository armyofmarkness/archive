# Grokking GraphQL

Like ReactJS, GraphQL is yet another technology for your APIs emerging from the juggernaut that is Facebook. It's a backend-agnostic data query language and runtime allowing a client, such as a javascript web app or mobile app, to query your application. It allows you to define a query that provides a common interface between the client and the server for data fetching and manipulations. It deals with a query language that allows the client to describe the data it needs and its shape, which is designed to build client applications by providing an intuitive and flexible syntax. (via)

Nathan Pointer of CBT Nuggets is a recent graduate of the University of Oregon and co-founder of the U of O student developer club. He's also really excited about GraphQL and can't wait to share what he's learned. His talk will focus on what makes GraphQL such a useful tool and how to get started using it in your next project.
