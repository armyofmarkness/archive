# Getting on board with ReactJS

We had a lot of fun with our ReactJS theme last time, but we noticed that many attendees hadn't really used React much or at all. So one of our members, Michael Tomcal, has stepped forward to do a more full talk about React geared toward developers who have some basic familiarity with Javascript but have never used React.

Michael will use slides and examples to give a good introduction to React. As always, we encourage conversation among novices and veterans alike. So if you're new to React, bring your questions; if you're already familiar with React, bring your experience and perhaps differing viewpoints.

Michael Tomcal is a Front End App Developer currently working for CBT Nuggets, a locally-based online training provider. Once again we'll be meeting in the space graciously provided by IDX Broker.
