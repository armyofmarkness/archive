# Machine learning for the web

## About

Thanks to the advent of current technologies machine learning has become a prominent field of interest for scientists, engineers, and businesses. With so many libraries, and frameworks coming up, any interest individual can now start trying out machine learning tools on their own. Join us at our next web dev talk where Antonio will explain what machine learning is, why it might be useful, and when we may want to use it. We will take a look at the latest online resources to get you started, and talk about potential uses within the web development field.
