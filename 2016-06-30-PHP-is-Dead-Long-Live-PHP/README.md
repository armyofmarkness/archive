# PHP is Dead, Long Live PHP

"When will PHP die?!" says many an exasperated developer. "It is dead," says a more snarky dev. As usual, the truth is a bit more nuanced than that. PHP is in a period of long-overdue progress toward maturation, and some pieces are dying, while there are some welcome new features becoming available as well as massively performance improvements. 

Max Schwanekamp will present an overview of where PHP has been, what PHP 7.0 brings to the table, and what's on the horizon with 7.1.
