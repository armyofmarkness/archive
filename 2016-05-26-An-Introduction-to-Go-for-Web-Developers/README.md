# An Introduction to Go for Web Developers

As a nice follow up from our last meet up on APIs, this month we'll be talking about the Go language. Recently Go has been gaining popularity for web applications, particularly for APIs and microservices. Daved, the founder and organizer of the EUG Go meetup, will lead off the discussion with an introductory presentation followed by Q&A.

If you're new to Go or you're an old hand with it, bring your questions, comments and snark. Well, not too much snark. Also BYOB. ;)

We have a couple options for venue downtown. I'm going to check them out to be sure one will work for us. I'll send a note notice on Wed to let you all know the confirmed location.
